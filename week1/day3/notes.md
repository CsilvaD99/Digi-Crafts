list and stuff
lis and array are the same

you acces thing inside a list using an INDEX

array = [dog]

reading a list if you know you say "this is o of 1" like the dog
insert o of n
read all is o of n

when thinking of time you are thinking of the WORST CASE senario because that breaks things

BIG O notation is time and space complexity

O of 1 is something that are simple for the computer to do like read an index easy to do like getting dog on a list with one thing in it

Creating a list if 0 of n. n= whatever the size of the list is. like worst case scenarion where to put 10 5787234 things depending on the size of the list

o of nsquared is n times n it just a worser case scenarion

constant- o(1)
logarithmic

<!-- reading a list at an index that we know array [1] takes constan time o(1)
updating a list at an index takes constan tim 0(1)
O(N)  is when you do not know where the item is beacuse the computer hass to read the whole array and then it can see where to upload/or update the list
