#loops
#loops are used to go through a specific amount of times and execute code every time it goes through it 

#It iterates over something 

#it iterates over list

#it can iterate over dicctionaries

#it can call something a bunch of times

#It can break you computer immediatly forever and you will have to restart comp

#while loop does something while this is true 2>1 is an example#

#while (condition to evaluate) while 2>1: indent print("yay")

#condition can be checked many times

#to  prevent infinite loop you have to make it stop after a few times

#example
#   num = 0
# while 2 > num:
#   print ("yay")
#   num+=1 which adds one to the number this loop prints 2 yays
#   num+=2 would have one yay

#len gives you the length of the list

#for - it's a type of loop

#ftuit = ("apple","pineapple","bannana") emojis are a string

#for  singular in list - "for" a single item of this list
#for fruit in fruits:
#   Print(fruit)  - this list apple then does a loop and then pineapple, the bannana but then it stops beacuse that is how long the list is 

# "for" most common used its more efficient

#you can 'pass' if you want to skip something 
#'else' can be used to list the res of the list

#name = input('What is you name?')
#print('Hello '+ name + '!')

#you can use the input function it waits for you to inputsomething 

#Name = input("what is your name?")
#Subject = input("what is your favorite subject?")
#print ((( Name +"'"+"s ") + "favorite subject in school is ")+ Subject +".")

#import random
#MyRandomNumber = (random.randint(1,10))



#star = '*'
#N = int(input("N"))
#for x in range(N):
 #   print(star*N) 

#the_answer = 23 + 32
#print("The answer is", the_answer)

#first_number = 23
#second_number = 23
#the_answer = first_number + second_number
#print("The answer is", the_answer)

#NamOfUser = input("what is you name? ")
#print("Hello %s, it is very nice to meet you!" % NamOfUser)




#NameOfFriend = input("What is your friend's name? ")
#NamOfUser = input("what is you name? ")
#print("Hello %s, it is very nice to meet you and your friend %s!" % (NamOfUser, NameOfFriend))

#greeting = "Hello %s, it is very nice to meet you and your friend %s"
#YourName = input("What is your name?")
#FriendName = input("What is your friend's name? ")
#print(greeting % (YourName, FriendName))
