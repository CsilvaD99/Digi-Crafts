    <p>this exercise is about making list</p>
    <ul>
      Here's what I like about list

      <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
      <li>That's about it</li>
      <li>
        I'm funna put another list item here because doing things in threes is
        cool
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      When you make a list, do it in this order

      <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
      <li>
        if it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
      </li>
    </ol>
